hello! today we are working on a new project! Yaay! I am so excited! I got my Hyte Y70 Case and it comes with this thing called the touch-infinite display. it uses a displayport loopback in the case to power a small screen that I just plugged in. I would like to write the context files to create the nix flakes to do the following. 1. Prevent Hyprland from grabbing the display in multimon. 2. Create a new locked down user account with no shell access. 3. Have Wayland start with that user automatically in that little display. 4. We can then use Hyprland again with a custom quickshell bar with widgets to display various statistics of the system. Such as Temperatures of core components (CPU, RAM, GPU, Ambient) in a horizontal line graph with legend. Usage of CPU, RAM, GPU, Mounted Partitions. A widget to change the backgrounds of the screen that the widgets are displayed upon, allow for static as well as animated as well as videos, as well as a visualizer for any music based on the logged in user (the person, not the shellless user account for the widgets. 4. Ensure that the touchpad on the display is captured by the Wayland session. 5. Allow swiping and tapping support to navigate the quickshell options for which widgets to display and extra pages of stats and histograms. 5. Ensure that it has customizable dimming settings for the screen. 6. Save this original prompt I sent you in a context file for future review during context window overflows.
